Why is anything intimidating?

Stand back everyone, I’m telling a story I’ve had several conversations with my
new found developer buddies about fitness, more along the lines of gym going and
nutrition actually.

One friend in particular Danielle Ormshaw asked why is going to the gym so
intimidating?

Why is exercise so intimidating. Can you blog on that?

About four years ago I was convinced I was going to end up with type two
diabetes.

Back then I knew relativity nothing about nutrition and fitness You probably
will feel like a berk in the gym, I know I did, then you realise that everyone
else there is there to do the same thing and they’re probably feeling like you
or have felt like you feel now. No one is there to judge, everyone had to start
somewhere.

Five and two diet

Gym

A whole new world 🙃

I’m not an expert, the fitness industry is massive and unregulated, any gymbro
can open a YouTube channel and be the defacto expert on whatever it is they’re
peddling.

It’s like with any industry there’s shysters and there’s people who offer
genuine advice.

People want to be given a sheet to work from and think hey that’s it, I do this
then I’ll look like Anthony Joshua in a couple of weeks, easy! The truth is it’s
hard, really hard, if it was easy everyone would be doing it!

Calories

Surplus = Gain weight

Deficit = Lose weight

Macros

What are macros?

Macros make up the calorie content of food:

1 gram of fat = 9 calories

1 gram of carbs (carbohydrates) = 4 calories

1 gram of protein = 4 calories

Don’t treat any of them as bad, there’s no ‘bad’ macros

Plan your food

Stay consistent

nutrition first workout last

Be aware of the calories you’re consuming, this is hard I know and you’ll
probably think your developing some form of obsessive compulsive disorder and
you’ll be ‘that person’ when you go out with your friends to eat — this is where
the consistency comes in.

Alcohol, stop it! It pains me to say that as a love a beer but beers is empty
calories, you can fit it with your macros if you like but it’s better to limit
it drastically, drink four times a week? Half it, drink once a week? Drink every
other weekend, some sort of system like that.

What do you want to go to the gym for? Lose a bit of weight and 'tone up’?

How do you think this 'tone up' is going to work?

Want to lose the love handles? Better do some core exercises, right?

Let’s do some isolation work on that

Ab work outs, crunches, sit ups, that thing where someone holds a 20 kg plate
and leans over to the side… those will not target and burn belly fat, you can’t
specify where you want your body to burn fat that is a myth you burn fat all
over your body. Love handles is genetically where your body is designed to store
your fat reserves.

Get your hear rate up!

You need to work for it
